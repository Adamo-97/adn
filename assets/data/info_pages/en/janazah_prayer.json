Janāzah prayer is conducted standing throughout, without rukuʿ, sujud or julūs. It can be conducted at any time. Wudhu’, adequate covering of the body, and facing the qiblah are required, as in any prayer."

An-Nasā’ī related the witness of four companions to the fact that this is a sunnah from a sound chain."

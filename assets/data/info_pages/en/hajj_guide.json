      "text": "Upon reaching the Miqat boundary, you don the two unstitched white sheets of ihram (men) or modest plain dress (women). No perfume, no cutting hair or nails, no marital intimacy. With hands raised in reverence, you chant the Talbiyah: “Labbayka Allahumma labbayk… Here I am, O Allah, here I am!” On arrival at Masjid al-Haram, you circle the Ka‘bah seven times (tawaf), pausing at the Black Stone to touch or kiss it if possible, whispering “Allahu Akbar.” Next, you walk and run between Safa and Marwah seven times (sa‘y), honoring Hajar’s desperate search. When your seventh lap ends, men clip or shave their hair; women trim a fingertip’s length. This completes your Umrah and releases you briefly from ihram’s restrictions, though you remain spiritually consecrated for Hajj."

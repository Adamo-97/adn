# Athan & Prayer Times App

A modern, cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter to provide essential tools and information for Muslims.

## üåü Features

This application is designed to be a comprehensive daily companion for Muslims, helping users practice their faith with the aid of modern technology.

- **Prayer Times & Athan Notifications:**
  The app provides highly accurate prayer timings based on the user's geographical location. It offers customizable notifications for each of the five daily prayers (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) and Sunrise, ensuring users are reminded of prayer times throughout the day. Users can select from various calculation methods to match their local conventions.

- **Detailed Salah Guide:**
  A step-by-step guide to performing Salah correctly. This feature is designed for both beginners and those looking to refine their prayer. It breaks down the components of Salah, including positions, recitations, and their meanings, potentially using illustrations and text to guide the user.

- **Interactive Prayer Tracker:**
  To encourage consistency in prayer, the app includes a tracker. Users can log their daily prayers, monitor their progress over time, and view their prayer history. This feature aims to help users build and maintain their habit of praying five times a day, with analytics to visualize their commitment.

- **Nearby Mosque Finder:**
  Using the device's location services, this feature displays a map with the locations of nearby mosques. Users can get directions, view mosque names, and potentially see information like prayer and Jumu'ah times.

- **Qibla Direction (Coming Soon):**
  An easy-to-use digital compass that will point users towards the Qibla (the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca), an essential tool for praying from any location worldwide.

- **Digital Quran & Dhikr (Coming Soon):**
  Direct access to the Holy Quran within the app, allowing users to read and search verses. This will be complemented by a Dhikr (remembrance) section, providing a collection of important supplications and a digital counter to aid in their recitation.

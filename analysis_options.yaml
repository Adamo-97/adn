# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

# No project-level rule overrides in this file - we rely on
# `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` defaults. Use in-line
# `// ignore_for_file:` or `// ignore:` comments for any remaining
# one-off suppressions if necessary.

# Exclude generated or staging code directories that should not be
# statically analyzed. NEW_SCREENS/ is a staging area for screens that
# are not yet integrated into the main app (see project README).

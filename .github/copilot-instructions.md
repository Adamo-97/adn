# Copilot Guidelines for Athan (Athan/Adhan) App

## Project Overview

This is a Flutter-based Islamic prayer application (Athan/Adhan app) that helps users track daily prayers, find nearby mosques, and access Salah (prayer) guidance. Built with Flutter 3.6+ and Riverpod for state management.

**Current Status**: Work in progress - frontend development phase only (no backend integration yet).

**Initial App Flow**: The `PrayerTrackerScreen` is the entry point (home screen). All screens/routes before it (e.g., app navigation screen, future login pages, onboarding flows) are subject to change and should not be relied upon for core functionality.

**Planned Evolution**:

- Original scope: Quran + Azkhar ‚Üí New scope: Prayer tracking + Mosque locations + Salah guide
- Folder/route names (e.g., `quran_main_screen`, `azkhar_categories_screen`) will be refactored to reflect new features
- `quran_main_screen` ‚Üí will become mosque locations/nearby mosques feature
- `azkhar_categories_screen` ‚Üí will remain Salah guide

## Critical Rules (DO NOT VIOLATE)

### NEW_SCREENS Directory (Code Staging Area)

- **Purpose**: `NEW_SCREENS/` directory contains ready-to-integrate screen implementations that are staged for gradual migration into the main app
- **Status**: These screens are complete and functional but not yet integrated into the app's navigation/routing system
- **Integration Workflow**:
  - When user requests a specific screen integration, move it from `NEW_SCREENS/` to appropriate `lib/presentation/` location
  - Update routing in `lib/routes/app_routes.dart` to include the new screen
  - Connect with existing navigation flows (e.g., `CustomBottomBar` tabs, screen transitions)
  - Update any dependencies, imports, or state management integration as needed
- **Cleanup**: Once all screens are migrated and integrated, the `NEW_SCREENS/` directory will be deleted
- **DO NOT** modify or refactor screens in `NEW_SCREENS/` unless explicitly requested - they are source code backups
- **DO NOT** reference `NEW_SCREENS/` paths in production code - always move/integrate first

### Refactoring & Code Quality (MANDATORY)

- Whenever generating or editing code in `lib/`, produce refactored, modular, and maintainable code by default. This means:

  - Extract UI pieces into small, focused widgets under the feature's `widgets/` folder.
  - Prefer compositional APIs (small functions and widgets) over long, monolithic build methods.
  - Keep visual output identical unless the user explicitly asks for visual changes; refactor for readability and testability.
  - Add minimal unit or widget tests for any non-trivial logic you introduce or change when practical.

- Do not modify files under `NEW_SCREENS/` unless the user asks for migration; instead prepare refactored code in `lib/` and follow the integration workflow.

### Commenting Policy

- Comments must be logical, informative, and explain intent, contracts, data shapes, and edge cases. They should not merely repeat the user's prompt or restate trivial details.
- Prefer doc comments (`///`) on public classes, methods, and complex logic describing:
  - Inputs and outputs (data shapes/types)
  - Side-effects and error modes
  - Success criteria and important invariants
- Inline comments inside functions should explain non-obvious decisions, algorithms, or trade-offs. Avoid comments that only paraphrase code.

### Asset Management

- **Asset Directory Structure**: Use only these existing subdirectories:
  - `assets/` - General assets
  - `assets/images/` - General images
  - `assets/images/home/` - Prayer tracker (home screen) specific assets (prayer icons, Qibla button, navigation arrows, etc.)
  - `assets/images/notifications/` - Notification bell icons (bell_adhan.svg, bell_pling.svg, bell_mute.svg)
- **NEVER** add new asset directories (e.g., `assets/svg/`, `assets/icons/`, etc.)
- **NEVER** add new local fonts - only use existing fonts: Poppins (weights: 300, 400, 600, 700) and Noto Kufi Arabic (weight: 500)
- All images must be referenced through `ImageConstant` class in `lib/core/utils/image_constant.dart`
- Use `_homePath` for home screen assets, `_basePath` for general assets
- **PLANNED**: JSON data files will be added to support static content display (prayer guides, mosque info templates, etc.)

### Core Application Configuration

- **NEVER** remove the portrait-only orientation lock in `main.dart`:
  ```dart
  SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations([DeviceOrientation.portraitUp])
  ```
- **NEVER** modify the `textScaler: TextScaler.linear(1.0)` wrapper in `MaterialApp.builder` - it prevents user font scaling overrides

### Naming Conventions

- **Use logical, semantic naming** for files, classes, and widgets based on their purpose and functionality
- **DO NOT** name files based on user requests (e.g., "modern_cards", "new_feature") - instead use descriptive names that reflect what the component does
- **Examples**:
  - ‚úÖ `salah_guide_card.dart` (describes purpose)
  - ‚ùå `modern_salah_card.dart` (describes style/request)
  - ‚úÖ `prayer_time_widget.dart` (describes function)
  - ‚ùå `new_prayer_widget.dart` (describes when it was added)
- Widget class names should match file names in PascalCase (e.g., `SalahGuideCard` in `salah_guide_card.dart`)

### Dependencies

- **NEVER** remove `flutter:`, `flutter_localizations:`, or `flutter_test:` from `pubspec.yaml` (marked with üö® CRITICAL)
- **NEVER** remove `uses-material-design: true` from `pubspec.yaml`

### Deprecated APIs and Modern Alternatives (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Always use current, non-deprecated Flutter/Dart APIs to avoid compiler warnings and future compatibility issues.

#### Color Opacity (REQUIRED)

- **NEVER** use `Color.withOpacity(double)` - it's deprecated and causes precision loss warnings
- **ALWAYS** use `Color.withValues(alpha: double)` instead
- Examples:
  - ‚ùå `Color(0xFFFF4444).withOpacity(0.15)` - Deprecated, will show warnings
  - ‚úÖ `Color(0xFFFF4444).withValues(alpha: 0.15)` - Correct modern API
- Apply to ALL color transparency operations throughout the codebase

#### Other Deprecated APIs to Avoid

- Monitor Flutter deprecation warnings during development
- Immediately replace any deprecated APIs when encountered
- Check Flutter changelog for migration guides when updating Flutter SDK version
- Run `flutter analyze` regularly to catch deprecated API usage

## Testing Strategy (COMPREHENSIVE & MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: All features must have thorough, production-grade test coverage using proper testing techniques.

### Test Organization

Tests mirror production structure under `test/presentation/<feature_name>/`:

```
test/presentation/<feature_name>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/                    # Widget tests for UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <widget_name>_test.dart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notifier/                   # Unit tests for state management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <feature>_notifier_test.dart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/                     # Unit tests for data models (if complex logic)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <model_name>_test.dart
```

### Testing Techniques (MANDATORY)

#### Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

- Test minimum, maximum, and edge case values for all inputs
- Example: For a counter with range 0-100:
  - Test: -1 (below min), 0 (min), 1 (min+1), 50 (middle), 99 (max-1), 100 (max), 101 (above max)
- Apply to: numeric inputs, string lengths, list sizes, date ranges

#### Equivalence Partitioning (EP)

- Divide input ranges into valid and invalid partitions
- Test at least one value from each partition
- Example: Age field accepting 18-65:
  - Invalid partition: < 18 (test: 17)
  - Valid partition: 18-65 (test: 18, 40, 65)
  - Invalid partition: > 65 (test: 66)

#### State Transition Testing

- Test all state changes in notifiers/state machines
- Verify state consistency after each transition
- Example: Toggle settings (on/off states)
  ```dart
  test('toggleDarkMode transitions correctly', () {
    // Initial state: true
    expect(state.darkMode, true);

    // First toggle: true -> false
    notifier.toggleDarkMode();
    expect(state.darkMode, false);

    // Second toggle: false -> true
    notifier.toggleDarkMode();
    expect(state.darkMode, true);
  });
  ```

#### Widget Interaction Testing

- Test all user interactions: taps, long presses, swipes, text input
- Verify UI updates correctly after interactions
- Test gesture target areas (minimum 44.h x 44.h hit boxes)
- Example:
  ```dart
  testWidgets('button tap triggers callback', (tester) async {
    bool callbackFired = false;

    await tester.pumpWidget(
      CustomButton(onTap: () => callbackFired = true),
    );

    await tester.tap(find.byType(CustomButton));
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();

    expect(callbackFired, true);
  });
  ```

#### Async Operations Testing

- Use `Future.microtask(() {})` or `tester.pumpAndSettle()` to wait for async operations
- Test loading states, success states, and error states
- Verify timeout handling and error recovery

#### Immutability Testing

- Verify state objects are immutable (new instances on change)
- Test that old state references remain unchanged
- Example:
  ```dart
  test('state maintains immutability', () {
    final initialState = container.read(notifierProvider);

    notifier.updateValue('new value');
    final newState = container.read(notifierProvider);

    // States should be different objects
    expect(identical(initialState, newState), false);
    // Original state unchanged
    expect(initialState.value, 'old value');
  });
  ```

#### Rendering and Layout Testing

- Verify all UI elements render correctly
- Test responsive sizing (different screen sizes)
- Check spacing consistency (use `.h` and `.fSize` extensions)
- Verify color correctness (including alpha/transparency)
- Test icon presence and sizing
- Example:
  ```dart
  testWidgets('renders with correct spacing', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(MyWidget());

    final container = tester.widget<Container>(
      find.byType(Container).first,
    );

    expect(container.padding, EdgeInsets.all(10.h));
    expect(container.decoration.color, Colors.blue.withValues(alpha: 0.5));
  });
  ```

#### Error Handling Testing

- Test invalid inputs and edge cases
- Verify error messages are displayed correctly
- Test error recovery mechanisms

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% for all new code
- **Widget Tests**: Cover all user-facing components
- **Notifier Tests**: Cover all state management logic
- **Integration Tests**: Cover multi-screen user flows (planned)
- **Golden Tests**: UI consistency verification (planned)

### Test Execution

- Run tests after every significant change: `flutter test`
- Run specific test files: `flutter test test/path/to/test_file.dart`
- Run tests for a feature: `flutter test test/presentation/<feature_name>/`
- Check coverage: `flutter test --coverage` (generates `coverage/lcov.info`)

### Mocking Dependencies

- Mock external dependencies (APIs, SharedPreferences, platform channels)
- Use Riverpod's `overrideWith` for provider mocking
- Example:
  ```dart
  setUp(() {
    container = ProviderContainer(
      overrides: [
        apiProvider.overrideWith(() => MockApiClient()),
        themeProvider.overrideWith(() => MockThemeNotifier()),
      ],
    );
  });
  ```

### Test Naming Conventions

- Test files: `<widget_or_class_name>_test.dart`
- Test groups: Describe the class/widget being tested
- Test cases: Use descriptive names that explain what is being tested
- Example:
  ```dart
  group('DarkModeWidget Tests', () {
    testWidgets('renders correctly with dark mode enabled', ...);
    testWidgets('toggles dark mode when tapped', ...);
    testWidgets('displays correct icon based on state', ...);
  });
  ```

## Architecture Patterns

### Feature Organization (Feature-First Structure)

Each screen follows this structure under `lib/presentation/<feature_name>/`:

```
<feature_name>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/              # Data models for the feature
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notifier/            # Riverpod StateNotifier + State classes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <feature>_notifier.dart
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <feature>_state.dart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/             # Feature-specific reusable widgets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <feature>_screen.dart  # Main screen entry point
```

Example: `prayer_tracker_screen/` contains models, notifier (with state), widgets, and the main screen file.

### State Management (Riverpod 3.x + Notifier)

- Uses `flutter_riverpod` ^3.0.3 with `NotifierProvider.autoDispose`
- **Single Source of Truth**: Riverpod notifiers manage ALL state - avoid mixing frontend state with Riverpod state
- Pattern for all features:

  ```dart
  // Provider definition (Riverpod 3.x)
  final featureNotifierProvider = NotifierProvider.autoDispose<
      FeatureNotifier, FeatureState>(() => FeatureNotifier());

  // Notifier class (Riverpod 3.x)
  class FeatureNotifier extends Notifier<FeatureState> {
    @override
    FeatureState build() {
      final initialState = FeatureState(...);
      Future.microtask(() => initialize());
      return initialState;
    }

    void initialize() {
      // Initialize state here
    }
  }
  ```

- Widgets consume state with `ref.watch(featureNotifierProvider)` and call methods via `ref.read(featureNotifierProvider.notifier)`
- All screens extend `ConsumerStatefulWidget` or `ConsumerWidget`
- **IMPORTANT**: In Riverpod 3.x, `StateNotifier` and `StateNotifierProvider` have been removed - use `Notifier` and `NotifierProvider` instead
- **PLANNED**: Extensive refactoring to ensure notifiers are the single source of truth, eliminating duplicate state

### Navigation System

- **Multi-Navigator Bottom Bar**: `PrayerTrackerScreen` implements persistent bottom navigation with independent Navigator stacks per tab (preserves per-tab history)
- Each tab has its own `GlobalKey<NavigatorState>` to maintain separate navigation stacks
- Zero-duration page transitions within tabs using `PageRouteBuilder(transitionDuration: Duration.zero)`
- Global navigation via `NavigatorService` with `navigatorKey` for cross-app navigation
- Route definitions in `lib/routes/app_routes.dart` as static string constants

### Responsive Design System

- Based on Figma design dimensions: 375√ó932px (defined in `lib/core/utils/size_utils.dart`)
- Use `.h` extension for responsive sizing: `width: 50.h` scales proportionally to device width
- Use `.fSize` for responsive font sizes
- All measurements automatically adapt via `Sizer` widget wrapper in `main.dart`
- Device type detected automatically (mobile/tablet/desktop)

### Cross-Platform Consistency (Android & iOS)

**CRITICAL**: All UI components, sizing, spacing, and interactions must work consistently across both Android and iOS platforms.

#### Font Sizing (MANDATORY)

- **ALWAYS** use `.fSize` extension for font sizes, NEVER use `.h` for text
- `.fSize` properly handles platform-specific font rendering differences between Android and iOS
- Examples:
  - ‚úÖ `fontSize: 16.fSize` - Correct
  - ‚ùå `fontSize: 16.h` - Wrong, causes inconsistent text rendering
- Apply to ALL text: titles, subtitles, body text, buttons, labels, hints, placeholders

#### Spacing & Sizing

- **Width/Height**: Use `.h` for containers, padding, margins, icons (e.g., `height: 40.h`, `padding: EdgeInsets.all(10.h)`)
- **Font Sizes**: Use `.fSize` exclusively for all text styling (e.g., `fontSize: 15.fSize`)
- **Border Radius**: Use `.h` for consistent rounded corners (e.g., `borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.h)`)

#### Touch Targets

- Minimum touch target size: `44.h x 44.h` for both platforms (follows iOS HIG and Material Design guidelines)
- Ensure adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Use `GestureDetector` or `InkWell` with proper hit boxes

#### Platform-Specific Behaviors

- Scrolling physics: Flutter automatically handles platform-specific scroll behavior (bounce on iOS, glow on Android)
- Back button: Android hardware back button supported via `WillPopScope` where needed
- Safe areas: Always respect `MediaQuery.of(context).padding` for notches, status bars, home indicators

#### Visual Consistency

- Use Material Design widgets that adapt to both platforms via Flutter
- Avoid platform-specific UI patterns unless explicitly required
- Icons should render identically using SVG format
- Colors must have consistent appearance (use hex values, not platform-named colors)

#### Testing Requirements

- Test on both Android and iOS emulators/devices before considering features complete
- Verify text rendering, spacing, and interaction on both platforms
- Check performance and animations on lower-end devices from both ecosystems

## Development Workflows

### Running the App

- **Windows/PowerShell**: Use `.\run_flutter.ps1` - automates clean, pub get, emulator launch (30s wait), then run
- Default emulator ID configured: "Medium Phone API 36.0" (customize in script)
- Standard commands:
  ```powershell
  flutter pub get
  flutter run
  flutter build apk --release  # Android release
  flutter build ios --release  # iOS release
  ```

### Common Tasks

1. **Adding a new route**: Update `lib/routes/app_routes.dart` with route constant and mapping
2. **Adding a new screen**: Create folder structure under `lib/presentation/`, include models/, notifier/, widgets/, and main screen
3. **State management**: Always use autoDispose providers to prevent memory leaks
4. **Images**: Add SVG/PNG to `assets/images/`, register in `pubspec.yaml` assets section, add constant to `ImageConstant`

## Component Library

### Custom Widgets (lib/widgets/)

- `CustomBottomBar`: Multi-tab persistent navigation with center icon notch
- `CustomImageView`: Unified image loader supporting SVG, PNG, network images, file paths with caching
- `CustomIconButton`, `CustomSearchView`, `CustomTextFieldWithIcon`: Themed form components

### Image Loading

- Extension method `String.imageType` auto-detects image format (SVG, PNG, network, file)
- Fallback to `ImageConstant.imgImageNotFound` for missing images
- SVG rendering via `flutter_svg`, caching via `cached_network_image`

## Theme System

- Access via global getters: `theme` (ThemeData), `appColors` (DarkCodeColors)
- Defined in `lib/theme/theme_helper.dart` and `lib/theme/text_style_helper.dart`
- **Current**: Dark theme implemented as 'lightCode' variant (naming is legacy, will be refactored)
- **PLANNED**: Light theme implementation with theme switching support
- Use `theme.colorScheme.primary` for colors, not hard-coded values
- Prepare for theme-aware color references that adapt to light/dark modes

## Localization & Internationalization

- **Current**: English only (`supportedLocales: [Locale('en', '')]`)
- **PLANNED**: Full Arabic + English support with RTL layout handling
- Uses `flutter_localizations` package (already configured)
- Will require l10n/i18n setup with `.arb` files for translation management
- UI components must support bidirectional text layout

## Environment & API Configuration

- `env.json` at project root contains API keys (Supabase, OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Perplexity)
- Currently populated with placeholder values - replace with real credentials before production
- Prayer times API integration pending (see TODOs in `prayer_tracker_notifier.dart`)

## Testing

- Test files in `test/` directory
- Run with `flutter test`
- Widget test boilerplate in `test/widget_test.dart`
- **PLANNED**: Comprehensive test coverage including:
  - Unit tests for all Riverpod notifiers and business logic
  - Widget tests for all screens and custom components
  - Integration tests for multi-screen flows
  - Golden tests for UI consistency verification

## Documentation

- **PLANNED**: Extensive inline documentation for all public APIs
- Doc comments (`///`) for classes, methods, and complex logic
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for major structural choices
- Component library documentation with usage examples

## TODOs & Known Gaps

- Prayer times API integration not implemented (placeholder "00:00" times in `fetchDailyTimes`)
- Current prayer detection logic pending real-time calculations
- Light theme not yet implemented (currently using dark theme despite 'lightCode' naming)
- Qibla compass and purification selection screens referenced but not fully implemented
- Arabic language support and RTL layout not yet configured
- SVG assets need reorganization into categorized folders
- JSON data files for static content not yet added
- Comprehensive test suite not yet written
- Extensive refactoring needed to eliminate state duplication between frontend and Riverpod

## Code Style Notes

- Uses standard Flutter lints (`package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`)
- Critical sections marked with `üö® CRITICAL:` comments - never remove
- Inline documentation uses doc comments for complex widgets (see `CustomBottomBar`)
- Equatable used for model equality comparisons
